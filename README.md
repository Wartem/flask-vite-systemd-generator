## Built With

This project integrates several excellent open-source tools and frameworks:

### Core Frameworks
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) - Lightweight WSGI web application framework by Pallets
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces by Meta
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Next generation frontend tooling by Evan You

### Development Tools
- [python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv) - Environment variable management
- [flask-cors](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/) - CORS handling for Flask
- [SystemD](https://systemd.io/) - System and service manager for Linux

### Acknowledgments
This project is built upon these powerful tools, serving as a simple integration layer to help developers quickly set up a development environment. All credit for the core functionality goes to the original framework creators and maintainers.

The scripts in this project mainly focus on automating the setup and configuration process, while the actual heavy lifting is done by these well-established frameworks.

## Why This Project?

This project aims to simplify the process of setting up a Flask-React application with SystemD integration. While tools like Create React App and Vite handle frontend setup well, and Flask makes backend creation straightforward, combining these with SystemD services involves several manual steps that can be automated.

### ðŸŽ¯ What This Tool Helps With

1. **Basic Service Integration**
   - Automates the creation of SystemD service files
   - Provides a simple interface for common service operations
   - Sets up basic logging and error handling
   - Includes reasonable default resource limits

2. **Development Setup**
   - Combines Flask and React setup in one step
   - Configures basic proxy settings for development
   - Sets up a development environment with hot reloading
   - Manages environment variables

3. **Service Management**
   - Offers a simple menu-driven interface for common tasks
   - Centralizes service commands in one script
   - Provides basic monitoring capabilities
   - Handles typical service operations

### ðŸ‘¥ Who Might Find This Useful?

- Developers learning to work with SystemD services
- Those who want to automate repetitive setup steps
- Anyone looking for a starting point for Flask-React projects
- Developers who prefer script-based service management

### ðŸ’¡ Important Notes

- This is a helper tool, not a production-grade framework
- The configurations provided are starting points and may need adjustment
- Security settings should be reviewed before production use
- The tool aims to simplify common tasks but doesn't replace understanding the underlying technologies

### ðŸ“‹ Limitations

- Basic default configurations that may need customization
- Limited error handling capabilities
- May not suit complex deployment requirements
- Should be reviewed and adjusted for specific security needs

## Prerequisites & Installation

### System Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js 14 or higher
- npm 6 or higher
- Linux system with SystemD (for production deployment)
- sudo privileges (for service installation)

### Dependencies

#### Python Packages
- Flask
- Flask-CORS
- python-dotenv

#### Node.js Packages

   chmod +x generator.sh
   ```

2. **Run the Generator**
   ```bash
   ./generator.sh
   ```

3. **Configure Project**
   - Enter your project name when prompted

- Ensure all prerequisites are properly installed
- Verify you have necessary permissions

## Development Guide

### Starting Development Servers

The project includes a convenient development script that starts both the Flask backend and React frontend servers:

```bash
./start_dev.sh
```

This script will:
1. Activate the Python virtual environment
2. Start the Flask development server
3. Launch the Vite development server for React
4. Set up hot-reloading for both servers
5. Configure the development proxy

### Development Environment

#### Backend Development (Flask)

The Flask backend is configured for development with:
- Hot-reloading enabled
- Debug mode active
- CORS configured for the frontend
- Proxy settings for API requests

To modify the Flask application:
1. Edit `app.py` in your project root
2. The server will automatically reload changes
3. Default API endpoint at `/api/test` for verification

#### Frontend Development (React)

The React frontend uses Vite for rapid development:
- Fast hot module replacement (HMR)
- Automatic proxy to Flask backend
- ES modules for instant updates
- Development server with HTTPS support

To work on the frontend:
1. Navigate to `frontend/src/`
2. Edit React components and assets
3. Changes appear instantly in browser
4. API calls automatically proxied to Flask

### Environment Variables

Development environment variables are stored in `.env`:
```bash
FLASK_PORT=5000      # Backend port
PROJECT_NAME=myapp   # Project identifier
```

Additional environment variables can be added as needed.

### Development Tools

#### API Testing
- Backend endpoints available at `http://localhost:5000/api/`
- Frontend dev server typically runs on `http://localhost:5173`
- Use the `/api/test` endpoint to verify connectivity

#### Logging
Development logs are available:
- Flask backend: Console output
- React frontend: Browser console
- System logs: `/tmp/flask_react_setup.log`

#### Development Proxy
The Vite development server is configured to proxy API requests:
- All `/api/*` requests forwarded to Flask
- WebSocket support enabled
- CORS handled automatically

## Production Deployment

### Service Installation

The project includes basic SystemD service management scripts:

1. **Build the Frontend**
   ```bash
   ./service_manager.sh
   # Select option 9: Build React frontend
   ```
   This creates an optimized production build in `frontend/dist/`

2. **Install the Service**
   ```bash
   ./service_manager.sh
   # Select option 1: Install service
   ```
   This will:
   - Create a SystemD service unit
   - Configure the service for your user
   - Set up automatic restarts
   - Enable the service to start on boot

### Service Configuration
